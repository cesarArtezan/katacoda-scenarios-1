## In this tutorial you will learn how to use MongoDB. 

This is an interactive tutorial that will guide through the basics for working with MongoDB.
Read the instructions and execute the commands in the linux shell on the right.

The teminal on the right is a preconfigured linux environment, with everything you need to run MongoDB.
It can be used as a regular linux shell - just type in commands.
To help you get started, we've included `code blocks` which you can click, and will be executed on the shell for you.

You can always refresh the browser and reload the tutorial if you somehow managed to mess up something. You will get a fresh clean environment.

While we recommend you to follow the tutorial, you are more than welcome to try out stuff for yourself - you have a fully
funcitonal MongoDB to play with.


Enjoy
